**Agent Oriented Software Engineering: A Comparative Study between methodologies that support the Development of Multi-Agent Systems**

Artifact in SWE : A by-product (tangible) produced during the development of models in software engineering
- Focuses on Prometheus (OO), Tropos(not based on traditional medelling techniques), MaSE (Multi Agent Software engineering) - based on OMT methodology
- MAS (Multi Agent Systems) were first conceived in AI systems so as to process data in an efficient and distributed fashion.
- Traditional software tools like UML(Unified Modelling Language) cannot handle the complexity of MAS.
* This paper presents many of the artifacts of the three different forms of MAS. Each one is distinct in many different ways, but still manages to satisfy the complexity of MAS.
* The paper recommends having a requirements mapping, after a model has been chosen.
