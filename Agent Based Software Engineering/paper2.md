**Towards smart factory for industry 4.0: a self-organized multi-agent system with big data based feedback and coordination**

- Usage of intelligent agents on the manufacturing floor, to acheive better throughput and efficiency in the manufacturing process
- Deals with interaction and cooperation between agents.
- Deadlock prevention between competing agents for the same resource
- Uses a central cood=rdinator to resolve conflicts
- Extensive use of big data to make decision and feedback loops
- lack of global coordination, makes MAS systems unsuitable for complex coordination tasks.
- Presents some of the initiaves by governments of Germany, USA and China regarding Industrial Internet
- This paper presents the following:
    - Model the shop floor as machines/conveyors as agents and products
    - Identify reasons causing deadlock
    - provide 4 solutions/strategies to resolve a deadlock
    - validate and verify this model, using Z language


* Makes use of IoT, Big Data Analysis and cloud infrastructure for the coordination between agents
* The industrial network collects info from all the objects in the manufaturing floor. This info at the cloud is used to enhance the decision making of agents
