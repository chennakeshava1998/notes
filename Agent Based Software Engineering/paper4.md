**An Automated Knowledge Discovery Framework
with Multi-Agent Systems - KDMAS**

- Meta data serves a very important role in increasing the value of existing knowledge. This paper aims to automate the process of scraping knowledge through various unstructured web resources using collaborative agents. The usage of intelligent, interactive agents presents new challenges. This method requires a complete holistoc view of the system, rather than incomplete part-information, which is often the case in many engineering problems.
- The paper makes extensive usage of Data mining techniques from the data ware-houses, and ontology based information.
- Some information regarding traditional approcahes using CRM based techniques has been presented in the introduction.
- KDMAS is built on 3 principles:
  - computation independent model (CIM): system view that does not show details of
system’s structure.
  - platform independent model (PIM): presents a certain degree of platform ndependence, to be suitable for use in different platforms.
  - platform specific model (PSM): combines the pecifications in the PIM with etails on how that system uses a particular type of platform.
  - KDMAS gives flexibility for both intra-agent and inter-agent modelling.
  - Intra agent control defines the agent’s lifecycle by coordinating the different modules that implement his capabilities
  - inter agent control defines the protocols that govern the coordination of the agents’ society.
  - For knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) the development process starts with use case analysis and ontology engineering.
  - The methodology starts with the identification of actors and
use cases of the system under design
- Each actor represents an agent role, each use case being a knowledge discovery process in which the actor takes part. Another task that has been accomplished in this early phase is the formal definition of the domain vocabulary or ontology.
- This paper aimed at demonstrating how the adoption of agent-based technology can provide automated information retrieval

- This research focused on the development of MAS that can be embedded also into dynamic environments.
