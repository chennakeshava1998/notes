**Verification & Validation of Agent Based Simulations using the VOMAS (Virtual Overlay
Multi-agent System) approach**

* This paper presents a way to validate the MAS which are widely used in diverse areas today like molecular simulations, chemical reactions, constructing/interpreting a knkowledge graph, distributed AI solutions etc.
* Validation of these systems is important because the software must match the conceptual model which is sought to be built.
* So, a Virtual Overlay MAS is proposed. These agents are kept over the proposed software solution. They can be designed under various constraints. All the data of interactions with these agents is logged in real-time and the any violations and the consequent history can also be viewed. 

**Introduction:**
* Simulations are only an approximation of the original system. If it was so easy to simulate a system, then the original system itself would have been reproduced.
* There are numerous variables in a MAS. Changing even a few variables might completely change the answers of the simulations.
* Subject Matter Experts(SME) are required to analyse the validation process in multi agent systems.
* Companion Modelling: multidisciplinary researchers and stakeholders work together continuously throughout a four-stage cycle: field study and data analysis; role-playing games; agent-based model design and implementation; and intensive computational experiments
* This work relates to the last 2 stages in companion modelling.
* Innovations in this paper:
  * VOMAS - MAS systems for validating agent-based simulations.
  * Validations for social science simulations, which can also be used in other domains.
  * OO based model, facilatiting logging, animation based error analysis

**VERIFICATION , VALIDATION AND CREDIBILITY:**
- Real worl scenarios are abstracted away for simluations - simulations are used to perform experiments to obtain useful data.
- Effectiveness of the experiments depend on the quality of these abstractions
- Agent Based models: multiple agents can either act independently or interact with each other. Every agent stores varied type of information - It could be simple things like variables, or complex info like ANN, etc.

**Definition of terms:**
- Validation: Is the abstracted model, a correct representation of the system
- Verification: Is the system working correctly?
- Credibility is established only when all the stakeholders accept the validity and the verification of the system.
- VOMAS allows SME to check the logs of the simulations and verify the results.
