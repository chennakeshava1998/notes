**The Architecture of Agent-Based Intelligent Tutoring System for the Learning of Software Engineering Function Point Metrics**
- Intelligent agent based software to improve the learning experiance for a student
- This paper demonstrates this idea for a software engineering student under the subtopic of function point metrics
- Uses interactive visualizations, question answers, diagrams etc.
- Helps the subject matter expert asses how much of skills has been gained by the student
- The autonomy, proactivity of intelligent agents makes it easy to construct a tutoring system
- It is possible to create a personalised system of learning model, tailored to every student's individual needs.
- Each agent has - Learner model, domain model and tutoring model
* Intelligent agent is embedded into the tutoring system, allowing the agent to use the added knowledge to answer questions and solve problem

* Agent based software mdoels can be used to build complex, distributed softwares - enhancing the efficiency of a process.

* domain model: knowledge the student need to be taught.
* instructional model: knowledge on various instructional and educational methods which describes how the knowledge of the domain model is transferred to student. 
* learner model: aspects that are relevant for the instruction such as facts, observations of student behavior.
* interface: communication between the student (learner) and the intelligent tutoring system.
* pedagogical expertise: facilitate the student in the learning process from the current knowledge state to other and better knowledge state

- The system can make inferences about learner's knowledge
- Each of the models contains information in the form of kowledge databases(approx 3 in each of the models)
- The agents will store and learn the following experience: observing the learner's actions or behavior, adaptation to the user's feedback, trained by the user, seek advice from other agent and assist other users.
- The properties of agents as given in the paper - autonomously (realise a set of goals), social ability, proactiveness, and persistence - interact with the users.
