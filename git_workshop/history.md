## Git History
`git log` shows the latest commits first - SHA-1 checksum, author's name, email-ID, commit message, date and  time of the commit

**Options:**
- `git log -<max_number_of_req_commits>` : limits the number of commits shown
- `git log -p`, `git log --patch` : Displays the log info showing the differences/modifications introduced in each commit
- `git log --stat` : Gives useful statistics below every commit, the number of files changed, what files are changed, number of insertions/deletions in those files and puts a sumary of the information at the end
