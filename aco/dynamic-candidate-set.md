#### Contributions:
1. This paper tests the application of two _dynamic candidate set strategies_ - Elite Candidate Set and Evolving Set to two combinatorial optimization problems - Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP) and Car Sequencing Problem(CSP). 

2. Static Condidate Sets can be easily applied when the there is a strong relationship amongst the elements of the problem.

3. The results of using dynamic candidate sets is compared with the gains of static candidate sets.

4. Control parameters for Elite Set : Size of the Set & Refresh Frequency; Evolving Set : Tabu Tenure and Tabu Threshold.

4. The control parameters for both the candidate set strategies have been specified. The lower and upper bounds in evolving set is chosen keeping a 10% margin. The mean cost of the solutions produced is used as a measure of the quality of the population of solutions.

5. Different candidate sets perform differently with different problems. The reason behind this inconsistency needs to be explored.

6. Effect of the control parameters on accuracy of solution and computational time needs more examination.
